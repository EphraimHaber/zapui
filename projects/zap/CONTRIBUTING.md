## Coding Standards

To maintain a clean and consistent codebase, adhere to the following conventions:

### Naming Conventions
- Use **camelCase** for variables and inputs.
- Start component selector names with `zap-` instead of `app-`.
- Prefix component class names with `Zap`, but do not end them with `Component`.

### Imports
- Place external imports before internal file imports.
- Add a space between external and internal imports.
- Treat Angular imports as external imports.

### Code Organization
- Place `@ViewChild` and `@ViewChildren` decorators at the top of the class.
- Follow with `@Output` decorators.
- Then, list `@Input` decorators.
- Use `@for` and `@if` instead of `*ngFor` and `*ngIf`.

### Best Practices
- **Avoid magic numbers** – Use constants instead.
- **Remove unnecessary comments** – Only keep comments that add value.
- **Maintain clean formatting** – No double empty lines.
- **Minimize use of `any`** – Only use it when necessary.
- **Keep methods short and concise** – Avoid overly long functions.
- **Follow the DRY principle** – Don't repeat yourself.
