## Getting started

Zap/UI is a comprehensive library designed to streamline the development of
Angular applications with a consistent and customizable design system. It
leverages the power of Tailwind CSS to provide a set of pre-designed
components and utilities that can be easily integrated into your projects.
Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, Zap UI
helps you maintain a cohesive look and feel throughout your application.
